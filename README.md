# YUM YUM | Ramen bar

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/da238cbf-9aa8-4b5d-8748-041cb9a02f16/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/yumyumm/deploys)

A school assignment where I had to make use of all the React fundamentals that I've learned so far. My personal goal was to try out a Headless CMS, with that in mind I decided to develop a simple restaurant website powered by **Contentful API**.

### Requirements

Assignment requirements: 
- It should be built in ReactJS
- Should implement nice graphical user interface.
- Can't use any third-party frameworks such as jQuery.
- Can't contain any errors, warning or notices in the developer console.
- Should consist of at least three react components.
- Should include both stateless and stateful components and should use state and props.
- Should include at least one API call. And its data should be presented.
- Needs to be uploaded and presented on Netlify or Vercel


## What I've learned so far

- Contentful was super easy to set up with React, I was amazed by how simple it was to get a Headless CMS up and running. The learning curve isn't too steep
- Styling with Styled Components. Sceptical at first, but I really enjoyed working with it and it's easy to manage the CSS with every bit of styling tied to a specific component
- Using environment variables to keep my API keys secret, safe & secure
- How to use `useEffect` Hook to fetch data and `useState` Hook to save the results
- How to use array map() to loop through contents from Contentful
- React-router-dom. Learned to wrap `index.js` with `<BrowserRouter>` for routes to work properly
- How to implement a interactive google map with custom map styling
- How to properly deploy to netlify by adding environment variables in their deploy settings
